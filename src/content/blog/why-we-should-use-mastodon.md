Recently, There's a news from Elon.
The tweet was like this:

> Twitter's name has changed to 'X.com'

When I heard that, I was really & really surprised.

"WHAT!?" I said.

But I also thought like this:

> If Twitter falls in popularity, then is the chance to change the king of social media to **Mastodon** from **Twitter**.

You made it, Elon :)

## Comparing Twitter And Mastodon

They are very different, so I can't compare them easily.
But I can tell you about a few of their identity.

### 1. The System Of App

Twitter is called "Centralized Social Media".
It means Twitter is managed by only one company, so it's not democratic.

But, Mastodon is different.

Mastodon is called "**De**centralized Social Media".
It means Mastodon is managed by so many companies and individuals, so I think Mastodon is very democratic.

> Strictly, Mastodon has so many servers and the each of them has only one operator.
> So, if your server's operator has be displeased with you, the operator can delete you from the server.
> But it's the big advantage from Twitter that you can choose the operator(server).

I think Mastodon wins in this point.

### 2. The Number of Users

I admit that Twitter has far more users than Mastodon, but Mastodon has many users too.

Actually, Mastodon has over a million MAUs.
I think with this much users, you can enjoy the social media.

> Actually, Twitter's MAU is over 0.3 billion, wow. :(

In summary, Twitter wins in this point.

## Is There Any Other Decentralized Social Medias Besides Of Mastodon?

Yes, but almost of them uses the same protocol as Mastodon.

It called "ActivityPub".
Many social medias uses it such as Misskey, GNU Social, Pleroma and Threads.

All of their users can communicate each other.

Also some of the decentralized social medias uses other protocols.

### 1. AT Protocol

AT Protocol is used by Bluesky.

### 2. (!) Nostr

Nostr is very smart protocol.
It is very difficult to tell you about all of them, so if you wanna know, please search it.

> Actually, it is not decentralized. it classified as distributed.

## Conclusion

I don't think Twitter is not good, but I think Mastodon is better than Twitter.

If you wanna join Mastodon, let's search "mastodon.social".

See'ya again for the next post!
