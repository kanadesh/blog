# Welcome to my blog!

Welcome to kanadesh's blog.

I'm a student in Japan that's learning English and cs.
I'll write posts in Japanese or English in this blog. (But it'll be mainly Japanese)

I'm not a native English speaker and I don't use machine translation, so my English might be messy.

Let's read my blog!

Go the `/blog` directory and see my contents.
